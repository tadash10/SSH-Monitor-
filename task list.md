Areas for Improvement

    Security of SMTP Credentials:
        While moving to environment variables is a step in the right direction, consider using libraries like python-dotenv to manage environment variables more easily, especially if the script might be deployed across multiple environments.

    Configuration Management:
        Implement a configuration file (JSON or YAML) as you mentioned. This can centralize your configuration and make it easier to manage, especially if you need to adjust parameters frequently.

    Regex Improvements:
        Ensure the regex captures all potential variations in your logs (like different SSH service configurations). Consider adding tests with different log formats to validate your regex matches.

    Performance:
        Instead of reading the log file line by line in a blocking manner, consider using asynchronous I/O or even a library like watchdog to monitor the file system changes. This can enhance performance, especially on systems with high log volumes.

    Alert Throttling:
        Implement a more configurable alert throttling mechanism, such as allowing the user to specify a cooldown period (e.g., how often alerts can be sent for the same IP). This can help prevent flooding your email with alerts for the same issue.

    Unit Testing:
        Write unit tests for critical functions like send_alert and monitor_ssh. This can help catch issues early and ensure your logic remains intact as you make changes.

    Fail2ban Integration:
        As you suggested, integrating with Fail2ban can provide immediate defense against IPs that are repeatedly attempting to log in. This could be a valuable enhancement.

    Documentation:
        Add inline comments and docstrings to explain the purpose of functions and key logic sections. This is crucial for maintainability, especially in collaborative environments.

    Exit Gracefully:
        The script runs indefinitely; consider implementing a clean exit strategy (like handling keyboard interrupts) to allow for graceful shutdowns and resource cleanup.
