The provided script is a good start for monitoring SSH login attempts and sending alerts for brute-force attempts. Here are some detailed feedback points and suggestions from a DevSecOps perspective:
Strengths

    Logging:
        The use of the logging module is a great practice for traceability. It allows for tracking of events and errors, which is crucial for security monitoring.

    Configurability:
        The script allows for command-line arguments, making it flexible and easy to configure for different environments and needs.

    Alerting:
        The alerting mechanism via email is useful for notifying administrators of potential attacks.

    Rate Limiting on Alerts:
        Implementing a cooldown period before sending repeated alerts helps reduce alert fatigue.

Areas for Improvement

    Error Handling:
        While there is some basic error handling for sending alerts, the script should also handle potential errors that can occur when opening or reading the log file. For example, it should check if the file exists and handle permissions issues gracefully.
        Consider logging errors in a more detailed manner. For instance, logging the specific exception message can provide insights into issues encountered.

    Security of SMTP Credentials:
        Storing SMTP credentials directly in the script or passing them via command line is a security risk. Consider using environment variables or a secure vault (like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault) to store sensitive information securely.
        Using app-specific passwords (if supported by the SMTP provider) can further enhance security.

    Regex Robustness:
        The regex used to match failed login attempts is simple but might need refinement to avoid false positives. Consider expanding it to better handle different log formats or even logging variations (like specific usernames or error messages).

    Alert Frequency and Control:
        Currently, the script resets attempts to 0 after sending an alert. Consider maintaining a history of attempts over a configurable period (e.g., 1 hour) instead of resetting immediately. This way, repeated attempts within a short time frame could still trigger alerts.

    Performance Considerations:
        The script reads the log file line by line, which is fine for small to medium log sizes. However, for larger logs, consider implementing a more efficient approach, like reading in batches or monitoring changes in real-time using inotify (Linux) or similar mechanisms.

    Integration with Existing Tools:
        The script could be enhanced by integrating with tools like Fail2ban for automated IP banning after exceeding the threshold of failed attempts. This would provide an additional layer of defense against brute-force attacks.

    Testing and Validation:
        Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure that the script behaves as expected. Testing can help validate that alerts are sent correctly and that edge cases (like log file changes or malformed lines) are handled properly.

    Documentation:
        While the script is relatively straightforward, including a more detailed README or documentation would be beneficial for users to understand how to install, configure, and use the script effectively.

Conclusion

Overall, the script is functional and serves its purpose in monitoring SSH attempts effectively. However, by addressing the above areas for improvement, you can enhance its security, performance, and usability, making it a more robust solution in a production environment.
