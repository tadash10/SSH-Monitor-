As a senior pentester, hereâ€™s some feedback on the SSH monitoring script along with recommended improvements:
Feedback

    Log File Path:
        The script uses /var/log/auth.log, which is common, but on some systems (like CentOS or Red Hat), it might be located at /var/log/secure. Consider adding a configuration option to specify the log file path.

    Regex Specificity:
        The regex currently looks for invalid user login attempts. It might miss other failed logins. Consider expanding the regex to capture all types of failed SSH login attempts.

    Handling IP Address Variability:
        Brute-force attacks often come from dynamic IPs or through proxies. You might want to implement some form of temporary blocking or tracking of suspicious IPs beyond just sending an email alert.

    Alerting Mechanism:
        Sending emails is effective, but it can lead to alert fatigue if multiple IPs trigger the same alert. Consider integrating a logging system (e.g., logging to a file or using a monitoring tool) in addition to email alerts.

    Rate Limiting Alerts:
        Implement a rate-limiting mechanism for alerts (e.g., only send one alert per hour for the same IP) to reduce noise.

    Threading or Asynchronous Monitoring:
        Depending on the system load and volume of log entries, consider making the log monitoring asynchronous or threaded to improve performance.

    Alert Content:
        Include more information in the alert, such as timestamps, total attempts, and possible mitigation steps.

    Configurability:
        Allow configuration of thresholds, alert email addresses, and other parameters via a config file or command-line arguments.
